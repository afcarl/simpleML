##simpleML
This repository is just for me to learn ML algorithm

### NN
I get the code from the web and modify some.
Then, I will use NN to do some work in NLP.
TODO: modify the backproparation to be a faster one by use matrix computation instead of loop




In 2014, I have write some ml algorithm code in python_ML where I learn the Andrew ng's MachineLearning course. But that
is a toy code, I just transform it to be a python version from the origin code In the course.

I will do more in simpleML, especially the algorithms in Industry.
